    Reagan's major achievement was the end of the Cold War as he left office. Furthermore, the USSR and Soviet-sponsored Communist movements worldwide were falling apart—and collapsed completely three years after he left office. The U.S. thus became the only \emph{superpower}. His admirers say he won the Cold War. After 40 years of high tension, the \underline{USSR} pulled back in the last years of Reagan's second term.
